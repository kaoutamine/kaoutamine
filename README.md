# Hi, I'm Kaou üëã

## About Me
- I'm working at **JobCloud** as a **Security Engineer**
- üéì Graduated from **ETH Zurich** and **EPFL**, with coursework spanning hardware, software, security, and machine learning.

Positioned across Software, Support, Management and Cloud, I‚Äôm constantly learning and adapting to serve as an effective security middle point. My work spans both hands-on technical tasks and the communication and coordination needed to align different teams and priorities.

On the side, I'm doing a bit of software work both to keep my skills fresh and for my own fun. 
## What I've (recently) been Working On
- My daily work =>  L1‚ÄìL2-L3 incident response, threat modeling, and software design reviews, AWS and Microsoft 365 security (Entra ID, Defender, Purview), Bug bounty handling. , external report reviews, Disaster recovery, support audits and compliance efforts... I could go on forever about the wide lists of tasks of a classic security engineer in a company built around software.

üõ†Ô∏è **Travian Automation Bot**  
I built a fully automated system for [Travian](https://www.travian.com), a classic browser strategy game ‚Äî mostly to have fun, streamline gameplay, and sharpen my software skills.  
üëâ [Check out the repo here](https://github.com/kaoutamine/travian_legends_bots)

This bot reverse-engineers both the API and HTML layers of the game. It authenticates with auto-retry logic, parses GraphQL responses, and interacts with form-based endpoints to simulate real user actions. I implemented modular raid planning with persistent configurations, support for multiple factions with unit mapping, and multithreaded logic to handle hero dispatching independently from troop usage.

It parses unstructured oasis data, estimates combat difficulty by analyzing animal types and counts, and can even simulate raids by querying Travian‚Äôs internal fight simulator ‚Äî letting you plan attacks without risking actual units. The system is modular and extensible, with room to support more tribes, building automation, and full resource management.
