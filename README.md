# Hi, I'm Kaou 👋

I'm currently working at **JobCloud** as a **Security Engineer**, collaborating with Cloud Engineers and 150+ Software Engineers to secure our cloud, software, and employees.

## About Me

- 🎓 Graduated from **ETH Zurich** and **EPFL** with experience across hardware, software, security, and machine learning.
- 🛡️ Special interest in the **defense industry**, especially maritime, aerial, and drone warfare.
- 🚀 Long-term goal: lead a project in the defense sector. Until then, I'm building a strong foundation in security and software engineering.

## What I'm Working On

Because I want to code more regularly (and because I genuinely love it), I'm working on a few side projects:

- **[LeetCode Practice](https://leetcode.com/user1238lu/)**: Algorithms were one of my favorite topics in college, and I’m keeping my edge by solving problems regularly.
- **Travian Automation**: I'm building a script to automate parts of **Travian**, an online strategy game for fun and convenience and to keep my software skills with my security skills.
- **Drone Counterwarfare Project**: I'm privately working on a **drone counterwarfare system**. (If you're in the defense industry and happen to land here — know that I'm very interested in this space.)

## Fun Fact

I'm deeply passionate about defense and military technology.
In my free time, I read extensively about maritime warfare (surface, subsurface, and aerial), drone warfare, and aerial combat.
I've attended airshows, had the opportunity to visit French nuclear submarines, and can recognize most modern fighter aircraft flying today.
I'm also a strong believer in the need for Europe to develop a resilient and independent defense industry — one that can stand tall without relying on the United States.
