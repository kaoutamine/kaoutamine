# Hi, I'm Kaou 👋

## About Me
- I'm working at **JobCloud** as a **Security Engineer**, collaborating with Cloud Engineers and 150+ Software Engineers to secure our cloud, software, and people.
- 🎓 Graduated from **ETH Zurich** and **EPFL**, with coursework spanning hardware, software, security, and machine learning.

Positioned across Software, Corporate, Management, and Cloud, I’m constantly learning and adapting to serve as an effective security middle point. My work spans both hands-on technical tasks and the communication and coordination needed to align different teams and priorities.

On the side, I'm doing a bit of software work both to keep my skills fresh and for my own fun. 
## What I'm Working On

- 🛠️ Building a script to automate parts of [Travian](https://www.travian.com) — a classic online strategy game — for fun, convenience, and to keep my software skills sharp. Check it out here: [Travian Automation GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kaoutamine/travian_legends_bots).

## If You're Here for ML/Software Projects

- [Identifying Recrystallization in Stainless Steel Using Machine Learning on Acoustic Data](https://github.com/kaoutamine/ML_laser_powder_project) — grade 6/6 @EPFL, project for the Laboratory of Thermomechanical Metallurgy of EPFL under Claire Navarre
- [Estimating the Robustness of Deep Learning Fraud Detection on the Ethereum Blockchain Against Attackers with a Leaked Model](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mbxvnznrmbhv#c37320) — grade 6/6 @EPFL, project for the Decentralized and Distributed Systems Lab

## Fun Fact

I'm deeply passionate about defense and military technology.  
In my free time, I read extensively about maritime warfare (surface, subsurface, aerial), drone warfare, and air combat.

I've attended airshows, had the chance to visit French nuclear submarines, and can recognize most modern fighter jets just by sight.  
I'm also a strong believer in Europe's need for a resilient, independent defense industry — one that can stand tall without relying on the United States.
