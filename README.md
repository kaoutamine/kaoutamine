# Hi, I'm Kaou 👋

I'm currently working at **JobCloud** as a **Security Engineer**, collaborating with Cloud Engineers and 150+ Software Engineers to secure our cloud, software, and employees.

## About Me

- 🎓 Graduated from **ETH Zurich** and **EPFL** with experience across hardware, software, security, and machine learning.
- 🛡️ Special interest in the **defense industry**, especially maritime, aerial, and drone warfare.
- 🚀 Long-term goal: lead a project in the defense sector. Until then, I'm building a strong foundation in security and software engineering.

## What I'm Working On

Because I want to code more regularly (and because I genuinely love it), I'm working on a few side projects:

- **[LeetCode Practice](https://leetcode.com/user1238lu/)**: Algorithms were one of my favorite topics in college, and I’m keeping my edge by solving problems regularly.
- **Travian Automation**: I'm building a script to automate parts of **Travian**, an online strategy game for fun and convenience and to keep my software skills with my security skills.
- **Drone Counterwarfare Project**: I'm privately working on a **drone counterwarfare system**. (If you're in the defense industry and happen to land here — know that I'm very interested in this space.)

## Fun Fact

I read a lot about maritime warfare (sea, subsurface, sky), aerial warfare, and drone warfare in my free time. Always learning, always building!
