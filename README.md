# Hi, I'm Kaou 👋

I'm currently working at **JobCloud** as a **Security Engineer**, collaborating with Cloud Engineers and 150+ Software Engineers to secure our cloud, software, and people.

## About Me

- 🎓 Graduated from **ETH Zurich** and **EPFL**, with coursework spanning hardware, software, security, and machine learning.
- 🛡️ Strong interest in the **defense industry**, especially maritime, aerial, and drone warfare.
- 🚀 Long-term goal: lead a major project in the defense sector. Until then, I'm building a solid foundation in security and software engineering.

## What I'm Working On

I want to code more regularly (and because I genuinely love it), so I'm working on a few side projects:

- 🛠️ Building a script to automate parts of [Travian](https://www.travian.com) — a classic online strategy game — for fun, convenience, and to keep my software skills sharp. Check it out here: [Travian Automation GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kaoutamine/travian_legends_bots).
- 🚁 **Drone Counterwarfare Project**: Privately working on a **drone counterwarfare system**. (If you're in the defense industry and happen to land here — know that I'm *very* interested in this space.)
- 🧠 **LeetCode Practice**: Keeping my algorithms skills fresh by solving problems regularly. [Here’s my LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/user1238lu/).

## If You're Here for ML/Software Projects

- [Identifying Recrystallization in Stainless Steel Using Machine Learning on Acoustic Data](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qfvnxcgwnnpd#ad813c) — grade 6/6 @EPFL
- [Estimating the Robustness of Deep Learning Fraud Detection on the Ethereum Blockchain Against Attackers with a Leaked Model](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mbxvnznrmbhv#c37320) — grade 6/6 @EPFL

## Fun Fact

I'm deeply passionate about defense and military technology.  
In my free time, I read extensively about maritime warfare (surface, subsurface, aerial), drone warfare, and air combat.

I've attended airshows, had the chance to visit French nuclear submarines, and can recognize most modern fighter jets just by sight.  
I'm also a strong believer in Europe's need for a resilient, independent defense industry — one that can stand tall without relying on the United States.
