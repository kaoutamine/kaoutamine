# Hi, I'm Kaou üëã

## About Me
- I'm working at **JobCloud** as a **Security Engineer**
- üéì Graduated from **ETH Zurich** and **EPFL**, with coursework spanning hardware, software, security, and machine learning.

Positioned across Software, Support, Management and Cloud, I‚Äôm constantly learning and adapting to serve as an effective security middle point. My work spans both hands-on technical tasks and the communication and coordination needed to align different teams and priorities.

On the side, I'm doing a bit of software work both to keep my skills fresh and for my own fun. 
## What I've (recently) been Working On
- My daily work =>  L1‚ÄìL2-L3 incident response, threat modeling, and software design reviews, AWS and Microsoft 365 security (Entra ID, Defender, Purview), Bug bounty handling. , external report reviews, Disaster recovery, support audits and compliance efforts... I could go on forever about the wide lists of tasks of a classic security engineer in a company built around software.

- üõ†Ô∏è Building a script to automate parts of [Travian](https://www.travian.com) ‚Äî a classic online strategy game ‚Äî for fun, convenience, and to keep my software skills sharp. Check it out here:

I reverse engineered API calls, explored HTML dumps to extract relevant informations, set up multithreading for hero/village operations, implemented login retry logic.
Had loaads of fun. Was top 10 in a server for about 2 months before I got bored of the game :D
